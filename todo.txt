1. after delete: does not show 'NZBs deleted' msg -> only works with sleep in
1367 main!!!!

2. pause / resume / closeall during postprocessing

---- start here ----
3. auto-turn off server: if all download fail on server - turn it off for this
nzb!
4. for 2nd nzb -> does not show Logs until 1st rar is loaded! happens after
renamer is started, oder so ... !??
5. test what happens if no internet at all!!
