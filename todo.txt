# parallel download

1. nzb nzb parser in case ginzibix terminated -> should work, test
2. nzbparser takes too long to start up with many nzbs -> problem is 1114 ff in main.py
4. messages "downloaded" and "md5 hash does not match" not in sync
5. show overall eta in gui / NZB_QUEUE
6. if press on_select in NZB_HISTORY -> no headers in NZB_QUEUE anymore!
   gtkgui l275 - get_selection ?????
7. implement "add nzb" feature in gtkgui / NZB_QUEUE
8. restart ginzibix with interrupted download before hangs / is slow with many
nzbs
9. NZB_HISTORY only updated if NZB_QUEUE is updated
